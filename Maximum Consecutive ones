Idea - Sliding window problem, take left pointer and right pointer then keep the count of temp==(max 0 can be flipped) if temp <0 them we have extra 0 in our window then check wheather left is 0 or not, if it is then we can 
reduce then number of zeros by incrementing left as well as temp to 0, if not just skip current 1 and temp remains <0;

int traffic(int n, int m, vector<int> vehicle) {
    int right=0;
    int left=0;
    int temp =m;
    while(right<n){
        if(vehicle[right]==0){
            temp--;
        }
        if(temp<0){
            if(vehicle[left]==0){
                temp++;            

            }
            left++;
        }
        right++;
    }
	return right-left;
}
